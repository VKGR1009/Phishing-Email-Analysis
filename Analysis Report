Key Indicators of Phishing

Mismatch Between Sender Address and Display Name
From: Microsoft account team no-reply@access-accsecurity.com
The display name uses “Microsoft,” but the domain is not a legitimate Microsoft domain. This indicates spoofing.

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Failures
SPF: none
DKIM: none
DMARC: permerror
Lack of proper email authentication is a strong sign of forgery.

Suspicious Link
solutionteamrecognizd03@gmail.com
This appears to be a fake contact posing as technical support to collect user responses or credentials.

Urgent and Alarming Language
"A user from Russia/Moscow just logged into your account… If this wasn't you, please report the user."
The message uses fear tactics to pressure the user into taking immediate action.

Grammar and Spelling Errors
"Recognized" is misspelled as "recognizd" in the fake email address, which is unprofessional and suspicious.

Misleading Subject and Impersonation
Subject: Microsoft account unusual signin activity
Although it pretends to be a system alert, the structure and headers confirm it is not from Microsoft.

Conclusion
This email demonstrates several indicators of phishing. It should not be trusted, and users should avoid replying or clicking any links. It is advisable to report such emails to internal security teams or use email reporting tools.
