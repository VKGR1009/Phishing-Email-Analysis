1. Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate a suspicious email that appears to be a phishing attempt. The focus is to identify indicators of compromise such as spoofed sender details, authentication failures, deceptive language, suspicious links, and social engineering techniques.

2. Sample Overview

Email File: sample-1161.eml

Subject Line: Microsoft account unusual signin activity

Sender Name: Microsoft account team

Sender Email Address: no-reply@access-accsecurity.com

Recipient: phishing@pot

Message ID: fece2c48-bea3-4a8c-aadf-5fc27029642d@DB5EUR02FT028.eop-EUR02.prod.protection.outlook.com

Reported Suspicious Link: solutionteamrecognizd03@gmail.com

Time Sent: August 19, 2023, 3:49:28 AM GMT+5:30

3. Header Authentication Check

SPF: none – No SPF records detected. The sending domain has not authorized any mail servers, allowing spoofing.

DKIM: none – No DKIM signature found; the integrity of the email content cannot be verified.

DMARC: permerror – The domain has a DMARC configuration error, which prevents enforcement or monitoring.

Conclusion: The lack of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC makes this email extremely untrustworthy and suggests that it could be spoofed or forged.

4. Sender Address & Display Name Mismatch

Claimed Sender Name: Microsoft account team

Actual Email Address: no-reply@access-accsecurity.com

Legitimate Domain Should Be: microsoft.com or outlook.com

Issue: The domain access-accsecurity.com is not related to Microsoft and appears to be an imitation meant to deceive the recipient.

5. Suspicious Links & Contact Info

The email includes a contact email: solutionteamrecognizd03@gmail.com

This is a free Gmail account, not a corporate or verified domain.

The word “recognized” is misspelled as “recognizd”, indicating unprofessional or automated generation.

Conclusion: This is likely a fake support address used to harvest personal information or initiate conversation with the victim.

6. Language Analysis & Urgency Techniques

The email body includes fear-based language such as:

"A user from Russia/Moscow just logged into your account from a new device. If this wasn't you, please report the user. If this was you, we'll trust similar activity in the future."

This uses location-based urgency, a common social engineering tactic.

The message attempts to create panic and urgency so the user responds immediately.

7. Spelling and Grammar Errors

“Recognized” is misspelled as “recognizd” in the sender email.

Other grammar inconsistencies are present, including improper punctuation and unnatural sentence flow.

Conclusion: These linguistic flaws are strong indicators of a phishing attempt.

8. IP Address Mismatch

The email claims login activity from: Russia/Moscow – IP: 103.225.77.255

Upon performing an IP lookup, this address is linked to A2 Hosting (United States), not Russia.

Conclusion: This mismatch further proves deception. The attacker is faking the source of the activity.

9. Secondary Sample Review (Europa Park)

Subject: Europa-Park Umfrage – Free Tickets Offer
Sender: otto-newsletter@newsletter.otto.de
Issues Noted:

SPF: Pass (with unknown IP) – Partial validation

DKIM: None

DMARC: Fail

Misleading claim of free tickets for a survey

Uses the same suspicious contact: solutionteamrecognizd03@gmail.com

Conclusion: This is part of a campaign-style phishing attack targeting multiple recipients using different themes (Microsoft login alert, free tickets, etc.) but the same malicious actor/contact.

10. Overall Assessment

Based on all technical and contextual indicators, the email is confirmed as a phishing attempt. The attacker uses:

Spoofed identities

Poorly configured email authentication

Social engineering tactics (urgency, impersonation)

Deceptive email addresses and contact links

Mismatched content and technical data

11. Recommendation

This email should be reported and blocked by mail servers and security tools.

The email domain (access-accsecurity.com) and contact (solutionteamrecognizd03@gmail.com) should be blacklisted.

Educate users to verify sender domains, avoid clicking on links in suspicious emails, and report such messages to the security team.
